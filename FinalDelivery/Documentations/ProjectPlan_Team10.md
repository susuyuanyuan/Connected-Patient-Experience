### Project Name

Project #22: Connected Patient Experience

## 1 Introduction

This application is focusing on patient user-friendly features. After researching the usage of a lot of the common patient portals nowadays, there are several functions (eg: making appointments, viewing lab results, requesting prescription refills, instant messaging with providers) most used by patients. Therefore, this application is trying to focus on these functions only, and make the App easy to use by implementing simple and concise user interfaces.

## 2 Process Description

The project development process contains the following activates:

1, Requirements Analysis

- This is the process to gather, analyze,  and define user expectations.  
- Entrance criteria: The user expectations will be closely gathered.
- Exit criteria: The user requirements will be analyzed, defined, and documented. Please refer to the Research Plan and Analysis for more details.

2, Application design

- This is the process to build the architecture of the application system to meet the specific user requirement.  
- Entrance criteria: The user requirements file will be used for this step.
- Exit criteria: This step will generate an UML diagram with detailed design-description, Initialize project plan, create use-case model, create test-plan, and create detailed design-documentation, which could be the  prototype of the application.

3, Application Developing

- This process is about coding and programing to realize the application design into real software.
- Entrance criteria: The application design diagram and documentation from will be used for this step.
- Exit criteria: This step will be focused on making sure that the code using chose language can satisfy the application design.

4, Application Testing

- This process is to compile and test the built application with a range of testing categories.
- Entrance criteria: The developed application from the previous step will be tested.
- Exit criteria: This step will test the application focusing on the functionality testing, system integration,  interoperability , and user acceptance testing with detailed documentations. The testing process will verify if the application realized the user requirements.

5, Application implementation and deployment

- This process is to ensure the developed application can be assessed by the user and met the user satisfaction.
- Entrance criteria: The tested application satisfying the QA requirements will be implemented.
- Exit criteria: The step will deliver the functional software with suitable maintenance and update as needed to ensure the new needs and additional user requirements.
